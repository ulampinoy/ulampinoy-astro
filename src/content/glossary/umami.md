**Umami** is one of the five basic tastes, alongside sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. The term comes from the Japanese word meaning "pleasant savory taste" and was first identified by Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda in 1908.

### Characteristics

- Often described as savory, brothy, or meaty
- Naturally occurring in foods like tomatoes, mushrooms, aged cheeses, and fermented products
- Enhances the overall flavor profile of dishes
- Key component in many Asian cuisines, particularly Japanese dashi broth

### Common Umami-Rich Ingredients

- **Fermented foods**: Soy sauce, fish sauce, miso, kimchi
- **Aged products**: Parmesan cheese, cured meats, dry-aged beef
- **Vegetables**: Tomatoes (especially sun-dried), mushrooms, seaweed
- **Meat and seafood**: Beef, pork, shellfish, bonito flakes

### In Filipino Cuisine

Filipino cuisine naturally incorporates umami through ingredients like:

- **Bagoong** (fermented shrimp paste)
- **Patis** (fish sauce)
- **Toyo** (soy sauce)
- **Dried fish and seafood**
- **Fermented rice** (like in burong isda)

### Scientific Aspect

Umami is primarily attributed to the presence of glutamate, an amino acid, and ribonucleotides like inosinate and guanylate, which create a synergistic effect when combined.
