Also known as banana heart or banana flower. It is the large, cone-shaped flower that grows at the end of a bunch of bananas. 

Banana heart can be found in most Asian markets or specialty stores that carry Southeast Asian ingredients. It can also be purchased canned or frozen, although fresh banana heart is preferred for its superior taste and texture.

**Nutritional value:** Banana heart is rich in vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, calcium, and iron. It is also high in dietary fiber and low in calories, making it a healthy food choice.

**Culinary uses:** Banana heart is a common ingredient in many Southeast Asian and Indian dishes, where it is often used in salads, curries, and soups. It has a slightly bitter taste and a firm texture, which makes it a good meat substitute in vegetarian and vegan dishes.

**Health benefits:** Banana heart is believed to have several health benefits, such as regulating blood sugar levels, improving digestion, reducing cholesterol levels, and promoting kidney health.
