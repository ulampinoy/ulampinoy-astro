Fish Sinigang is one of the dish you look forward to when you have too much land animal meat or too much vegetable lately. It is a perfect dish when you want to eat healthier. Fish smell is something acquired like liking a perfume, or liking the smell of cheese or patis that you can't resist yet for the others is something to avoid at all cost.

Sinigang is the most intuitive way of cooking seafoods, fish included. Like many seafoods dishes where there is the recurring aspect of acidity, like lemon, to bring out the flavors of the sea and tame these strong flavors. Acidity is a default to Sinigang, removed the sour factor and you will have **Nilaga** – another comforting Filipino dish. That's a topic for another article...

Cooking Fish Sinigang is actually very easy and less stressful as there are no menacing hot splats of scalding hot oil! A bit of effort is required when preparing the ingredients but after that it's just waiting the spiced sour broth base to boil and goes the rest of the ingredients. Cooking time really depends on cooking the vegetables since it takes no time at all cooking fish.

Let's cook our Ulam Pinoy version of Fish Sinigang...
