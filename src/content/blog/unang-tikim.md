## Love Served First

In many Filipino homes, there’s a quiet yet powerful gesture: the first scoop of _ulam_ — whether it’s _ginataang gulay_, _adobo_, or _sinigang_ — goes not to the family, but to a neighbor.

This act, known informally as the _unang tikim_, is a humble offering. It says, “You were in my thoughts,” or in Filipino, _Naalala kita_. It embodies the spirit of _pakikipagkapuwa_ — a deep cultural value that sees the other not as separate, but as a part of one’s self.

Even in households of modest means, this practice persists. It is not about abundance, but about presence. It is an invitation to eat, to connect, and to belong.

> “Food is meant to be shared, creating a sense of connection and gratitude.”[^1]

Sometimes, this kindness circles back. A neighbor may return the favor the next day, offering their own fresh dish in exchange — or simply a heartfelt _salamat_. In this way, food becomes not just sustenance, but a social thread that weaves neighborhoods together.

From the eyes of a visitor, this openness is striking. French expat Richard, who has lived in Manila for over a decade, once noted that “conversations always revolve around food” and how people readily offer a taste — even to strangers.[^2] This warmth is not a performance. It is everyday hospitality, embedded in the Filipino way of life.

Historically, communal eating and neighborly sharing trace back to pre-colonial village life, where bonds were formed not just through rituals, but over rice and stews shared under nipa roofs.[^3] The spirit of _bayanihan_ was not just for times of disaster — it was built daily, one bowl at a time.

At UlamPinoy, we believe these seemingly small customs hold the deepest flavors of our culture. When love is ladled into the very first bowl and given away, that’s the kind of heritage we’re proud to pass on.
