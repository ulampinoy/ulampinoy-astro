In this episode, let's upscale the usual pan-fried chicken fillets by making some blue cheese sauce with mushrooms.

The creamy gravy sauce gives the chicken additional depth and moisture while the blue cheese give a nice sharp contrast to it. The mushrooms add in another type of texture to the bite and _umami_ boost!

## Ingredients

- Chicken fillets
- Salt and black pepper
- Aromatic herbs _(oregano, thyme, rosemary - this is optional)_
- Cooking oil for frying
- Garlic
- Onions
- Mushrooms _(button or assorted)_
- Blue cheese _(Roquefort)_
- Heavy cream

Filleted (and deboned) **chicken thighs** are the preferred cuts for better texture and it's juicier than the chicken breast.

In the video we used bottle-preserved mushrooms but **fresh whole mushrooms** are the best if you can source it, because it offers some pleasant earthy, nutty flavors to the dish.

## Procedure

1. **Dust the chicken fillets** with salt, crushed black pepper and herbs on both sides. Set aside.
2. Heat some oil in a skillet pan and **fry the chicken fillets.** Fry until both sides develop a light crust and golden brown in color. When finished frying, set aside the oil and leave just a small amount.
3. **Sauté** the chopped garlic and sliced onions. Add mushrooms. Sauté for another minute or two. Add blue cheese. Pour in the heavy cream. Stir well while bring it to a mild simmer.
4. **Drop the fried chicken fillets into the sauce.** Stir thouroghly to cover the chicken with the gravy sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with parsley and serve.
