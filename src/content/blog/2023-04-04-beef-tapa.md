Here's a simple recipe to make Beef Tapa at home:

### Ingredients:

- 1 pound thinly sliced beef sirloin
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons vinegar
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- cooking oil for frying

### Instructions:

1. In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, minced garlic, and black pepper until the sugar is dissolved.
2. Add the thinly sliced beef sirloin to the marinade and mix until the beef is fully coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight.
3. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add cooking oil. Once the oil is hot, add the marinated beef and cook for 3-5 minutes per side or until the beef is tender and caramelized.
4. Serve hot with garlic rice and fried egg for a traditional Filipino breakfast.
